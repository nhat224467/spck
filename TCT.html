        <p>If you are looking for a tricky challenge in the Football Manager game series, you would be well-advised to consider launching a new save as Chelsea boss. </p> 
        <p>The London club have become poster boys for underachievement in recent years, with their new owners taking a scattergun approach to running the club. However, if you are willing to take on the challenge of managing Chelsea in Football Manager 2024 (FM24), you could end up immersed in a hugely rewarding game. </p>
        <p>Given the nature of the task you will be taking on with the club, it makes sense to arm yourself with tools which can improve your chances of success. </p>
        <p> An updated FM24 database would be extremely useful, as this provides you with the most up-to-date 'real-life' information when you launch the game. </p>
        <p>Birmingham City, Huddersfield Town and Rotherham United will all be vying for an immediate return to the Championship and given their squad quality, the trio have an excellent chance. </p>
        <p>Include Bolton Wanderers, Peterborough United and Charlton Athletic and the League One is packed with clubs who can put up a good fight for promotion. </p>
        <p>However, Wrexham's confidence is very high at the moment and they have made several shrewd signings in the ongoing summer transfer window. </p>
        <p>The Red Dragons have secured a permanent deal for goalkeeper Arthur Okonkwo, while Sebastian Revan and Lewis Brunt have also arrived from Aston Villa and Leicester City respectively. </p>
        <p>Manager Phil Parkinson could make a few more additions to the squad before the end of the transfer window. </p>
        <p>Championship promotion would be a huge challenge for Wrexham but their recent displays against Chelsea and Bournemouth in pre-season friendlies suggest they can pull off the incredible feat in 2024-25. </p>
