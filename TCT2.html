        <p>The Premier League's Golden Glove award recognises the goalkeeper who keeps the most clean sheets each season. </p> 
        <p>The award always goes to a top individual shot-stopper but the defensive efforts of their wider team is often a major factor. For this reason, the award typically goes to a man between the sticks at one of the league's strongest clubs.  </p>
        <h2>Alisson Becker</h2>
        <p>Alisson Becker is aiming for a hattrick of awards this year having been the clean sheet leader back in 2018/19 and 2021/22.</p>

        <p>The Brazilian started the campaign perfectly with two clean sheets in two and could continue that perfect streak against Manchester United on matchday three. In the Man Utd vs Liverpool betting odds his team is offered at 11/4 to keep their most impressive clean sheet yet. </p>
        <p>Liverpool's strong form in both defence and attack is predicted to be sustained long beyond the visit to Old Trafford this season, as according to a bet on Premier League today they are serious title contenders at odds of 11/2. The Reds will be expected to continue controlling fixtures and giving up few chances, which bodes well for Alisson's Golden Glove ambitions. </p>
        <h2>David Raya</h2>
        <p>David Raya is the current holder of the Golden Glove award. He achieved an impressive tally of 16 clean sheets in the 2023/24 season which made the award his by matchday 36. </p>
        <p>His team, Arsenal, have strengthened their squad further over the summer and have maintained their strong defensive setup that conceded just 29 league goals, which means he is well positioned to defend his honour. </p>

        <p>The Spaniard – like Alisson – also conceded no goals in the opening two fixtures of the season which is a positive sign in regard to the long-term race for the goalkeeping prize</p>
